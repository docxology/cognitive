## Core Learning Path

### 1. Economic Modeling (4 weeks)

#### Week 1-2: Market State Inference
```python
class MarketStateEstimator:
    def __init__(self,
                 n_agents: int,
                 market_dim: int):
        """Initialize market state estimator."""
        self.agents = [EconomicAgent() for _ in range(n_agents)]
        self.market_state = torch.zeros(market_dim)
        self.trading_network = self._build_network()
        
    def estimate_state(self,
                      market_data: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """Estimate market state from data."""
        beliefs = self._update_agent_beliefs(market_data)
        market_state = self._aggregate_beliefs(beliefs)
        return market_state
```

#### Week 3-4: Economic Decision Making
```python
class EconomicController:
    def __init__(self,
                 action_space: int,
                 utility_model: UtilityFunction):
        """Initialize economic controller."""
        self.policy = EconomicPolicy(action_space)
        self.utility = utility_model
        self.risk_model = RiskAssessment()
        
    def select_action(self,
                     market_state: torch.Tensor,
                     uncertainty: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """Select economic action under uncertainty."""
        expected_utility = self._compute_expected_utility(market_state)
        risk_adjusted_policy = self._adjust_for_risk(expected_utility, uncertainty)
        return self.policy.sample(risk_adjusted_policy)
