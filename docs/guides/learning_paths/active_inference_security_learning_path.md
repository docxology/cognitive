                 threat_levels: List[str]):
        """Initialize cognitive security monitor."""
        self.security_model = SecurityModel(security_dims)
        self.threat_detector = ThreatDetector(threat_levels)
        self.containment_system = ContainmentSystem()
        
    def assess_security_state(self,

        """Assess cognitive security state."""
        threat_assessment = self.threat_detector.analyze(information_state)
        security_measures = self.security_model.recommend_measures(threat_assessment)
        return self.containment_system.validate_state(security_measures)
```

#### Week 3-4: Infohazard Management
```python

                 containment_protocols: Dict[str, Protocol]):
        """Initialize infohazard management system."""
        self.hazard_classifier = HazardClassifier(hazard_types)
        self.containment = containment_protocols
        self.safety_verifier = SafetyVerifier()
        
    def manage_infohazard(self,
                         information: Information,
