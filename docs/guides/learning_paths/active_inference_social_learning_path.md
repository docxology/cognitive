                 n_agents: int,
                 state_dim: int):
        """Initialize collective state estimator."""
        self.agents = [SocialAgent() for _ in range(n_agents)]
        self.collective_state = torch.zeros(state_dim)
        self.interaction_network = self._build_network()
```

#### Week 3-4: Social Action Selection
```python
class CollectiveController:
    def __init__(self,
                 n_agents: int,
                 action_space: int):
        """Initialize collective controller."""
        self.policy = CollectivePolicy(n_agents, action_space)
        self.coordination = CoordinationMechanism()
```
