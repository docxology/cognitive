# Model Complexity

Model complexity represents the trade-off between model sophistication and computational efficiency in cognitive systems. Within the active inference framework, it implements precision-weighted model selection and complexity control through the minimization of variational free energy.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Complexity Measures
1. **Model Description Length**
   ```math
   L(m) = -log P(m) + D_KL(Q(θ|m)||P(θ|m))
   ```
   where:
   - L is description length
   - m is model
   - P(m) is model prior
   - Q(θ|m) is posterior
   - P(θ|m) is parameter prior

2. **Complexity-Accuracy Trade-off**
   ```math
   F(m) = D_KL(Q(θ)||P(θ)) - E_Q[log P(x|θ)]
   ```
   where:
   - F is free energy
   - Q(θ) is posterior
   - P(θ) is prior
   - P(x|θ) is likelihood
   - E_Q is expectation

### Optimization Theory
1. **Model Selection**
   ```math
   m* = argmin_m[F(m) + λC(m)]
   ```
   where:
   - m* is optimal model
   - F is free energy
   - C is complexity cost
   - λ is trade-off parameter

2. **Complexity Control**
   ```math
   C(m) = D_KL(Q(θ|m)||P(θ)) + αH(Q)
   ```
   where:
   - C is complexity cost
   - D_KL is KL divergence
   - Q is posterior belief
   - P is prior belief
   - H is entropy
   - α is complexity weight
