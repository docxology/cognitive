# Working Memory

Working memory is the cognitive system responsible for temporary maintenance and manipulation of information. Within the active inference framework, it represents a dynamic process of maintaining precision-weighted predictions about task-relevant information while continuously updating these predictions based on new evidence and goals.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Information Maintenance
1. **State Representation**
   ```math
   μ(t) = argmin_μ F(μ, s(t))
   ```
   where:
   - μ(t) is the maintained representation
   - s(t) is the true state
   - F is the variational free energy

2. **Capacity Constraints**
   ```math
   C = -log₂(∏ᵢ λᵢ/N)
   ```
   where:
   - C is the information capacity
   - λᵢ are eigenvalues of the precision matrix
   - N is noise magnitude

### Dynamic Updates
1. **Belief Dynamics**
   ```math
   dμ/dt = -κ∇_μF(μ,s)
   ```
   where:
   - κ is a learning rate
   - ∇_μF is the gradient of free energy

2. **Precision Control**
   ```math
   Π(t) = (Σ(t) + η(t)I)⁻¹
   ```
   where:
   - Π(t) is the precision matrix
   - Σ(t) is the uncertainty
   - η(t) is neural noise
