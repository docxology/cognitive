# Neural Efficiency

Neural efficiency represents the optimization of computational resources in neural systems through adaptive processing and metabolic regulation. Within the active inference framework, it implements precision-weighted neural computation and metabolic cost minimization through dynamic resource allocation.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Efficiency Dynamics
1. **Neural Cost Function**
   ```math
   N(t) = ∑ᵢ wᵢaᵢ(t) + β∫C(s(τ))dτ + γS(t)
   ```
   where:
   - N is neural cost
   - wᵢ are neural weights
   - aᵢ are activity levels
   - C is complexity cost
   - S is synaptic cost
   - β,γ are efficiency factors

2. **Computational Efficiency**
   ```math
   η(t) = I(t)/N(t)
   ```
   where:
   - η is efficiency
   - I is information processed
   - N is neural cost
   - t is time point

### Optimization Theory
1. **Information-Energy Trade-off**
   ```math
   J(a) = ∫[I(a(t),s(t)) - λN(a(t))]dt
   ```
   where:
   - J is objective function
   - I is information function
   - N is neural cost
   - λ is trade-off parameter
   - a is activity level
   - s is system state

2. **Synaptic Dynamics**
   ```math
   dw/dt = η(A⁺exp(-t/τ⁺) - A⁻exp(-t/τ⁻))S(t)
   ```
   where:
   - w is synaptic weight
   - η is learning rate
   - A⁺,A⁻ are potentiation/depression amplitudes
   - τ⁺,τ⁻ are time constants
   - S is spike timing function
