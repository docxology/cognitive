# Homeostatic Regulation

Homeostatic regulation represents the processes by which cognitive systems maintain stability through dynamic adjustment of internal states. Within the active inference framework, it implements the optimization of system parameters through precision-weighted error minimization and setpoint maintenance.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Regulation Dynamics
1. **State Control**
   ```math
   dh/dt = γ(h* - h) - λ∇_hF(h,x)
   ```
   where:
   - h is homeostatic variable
   - h* is setpoint
   - γ is adaptation rate
   - λ is free energy weight
   - F is free energy
   - x is environmental state

2. **Error Correction**
   ```math
   e(t) = h*(t) - h(t)
   u(t) = Kₚe(t) + Kᵢ∫e(τ)dτ + Kd(de/dt)
   ```
   where:
   - e is error
   - u is control signal
   - Kₚ,Kᵢ,Kd are PID gains

### Control Theory
1. **Feedback Control**
   ```math
   dx/dt = f(x,u) + η(t)
   u = -K(x - x*)
   ```
   where:
   - x is system state
   - u is control input
   - K is gain matrix
   - x* is target state
   - η is noise

2. **Optimal Control**
   ```math
   J = ∫(x'Qx + u'Ru)dt
   ```
   where:
   - J is cost function
   - Q is state cost matrix
   - R is control cost matrix
   - x is state vector
   - u is control vector
