# Evidence Accumulation

Evidence accumulation represents the process by which cognitive systems gather and integrate information for decision making. Within the active inference framework, it implements precision-weighted evidence integration and belief updating through hierarchical prediction error minimization.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Accumulation Dynamics
1. **Evidence Integration**
   ```math
   dE/dt = μ + σW(t) + λ∫ε(τ)dτ
   ```
   where:
   - E is evidence
   - μ is drift rate
   - σ is noise scale
   - W is Wiener process
   - ε is prediction error
   - λ is learning rate

2. **Decision Variable**
   ```math
   P(h|e) = P(e|h)P(h)/P(e)
   ```
   where:
   - P(h|e) is posterior
   - P(e|h) is likelihood
   - P(h) is prior
   - P(e) is evidence

### Decision Process
1. **Threshold Crossing**
   ```math
   T = inf{t: |E(t)| ≥ θ}
   ```
   where:
   - T is decision time
   - E is evidence
   - θ is threshold
   - t is time

2. **Confidence Computation**
   ```math
   C(t) = exp(-β|θ - |E(t)||)
   ```
   where:
   - C is confidence
   - E is evidence
   - θ is threshold
   - β is sensitivity
   - t is time
