# Memory Consolidation

Memory consolidation represents the processes by which initially labile memories are transformed into stable, long-term representations. Within the active inference framework, it implements the optimization of generative models through iterative refinement of predictions and precision-weighting during both wake and sleep states.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Synaptic Consolidation
1. **Weight Dynamics**
   ```math
   dw/dt = η(A⁺exp(-t/τ⁺) - A⁻exp(-t/τ⁻))S(t)
   ```
   where:
   - w represents synaptic weights
   - η is learning rate
   - A⁺,A⁻ are potentiation/depression amplitudes
   - τ⁺,τ⁻ are time constants
   - S(t) is spike timing function

2. **Stability Dynamics**
   ```math
   P(s'|s) = exp(-F(s',s)/T)
   ```
   where:
   - s,s' are current and future states
   - F is free energy
   - T is temperature parameter

### Systems Consolidation
1. **Schema Integration**
   ```math
   M'(t) = M(t) + α∫(S(τ) - M(τ))K(t-τ)dτ
   ```
   where:
   - M'(t) is updated memory
   - M(t) is current memory
   - S(τ) is schema structure
   - K(t-τ) is integration kernel
   - α is learning rate

2. **Network Reorganization**
   ```math
   C(t) = exp(-β∑ᵢⱼ wᵢⱼ(t)(hᵢ(t) - hⱼ(t))²)
   ```
   where:
   - C(t) is connectivity strength
   - wᵢⱼ are connection weights
   - hᵢ,hⱼ are neural activities
   - β is coupling parameter
