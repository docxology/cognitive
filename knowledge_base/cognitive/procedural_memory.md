# Procedural Memory

Procedural memory is the system responsible for the acquisition, maintenance, and execution of motor skills and cognitive procedures. Within the active inference framework, it implements precision-weighted prediction of sensorimotor consequences to minimize free energy across action sequences and skill performance.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Skill Acquisition
1. **Performance Optimization**
   ```math
   P(a|s) = argmin_a F(s, a)
   ```
   where:
   - P(a|s) is action policy
   - s represents state
   - a represents action
   - F is variational free energy

2. **Learning Dynamics**
   ```math
   dw/dt = -η∇_w F(s, a; w)
   ```
   where:
   - w represents skill parameters
   - η is learning rate
   - ∇_w F is parameter gradient
   - F is free energy

### Motor Control
1. **Action Selection**
   ```math
   a*(t) = argmin_a ∫ G(s(τ), a(τ))dτ
   ```
   where:
   - a*(t) is optimal action
   - G is expected free energy
   - s(τ) is predicted state
   - τ is future time

2. **Error Correction**
   ```math
   Δa = K(s_target - s_current)
   ```
   where:
   - Δa is action adjustment
   - K is gain matrix
   - s_target is target state
   - s_current is current state
