# Information Processing

Information processing represents the mechanisms by which cognitive systems encode, transform, and utilize information. Within the active inference framework, it implements precision-weighted information integration and model updating through hierarchical prediction error minimization.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Information Dynamics
1. **Processing Function**
   ```math
   I(t) = ∑ᵢ wᵢsᵢ(t) + β∫T(x(τ))dτ + γH(t)
   ```
   where:
   - I is information content
   - wᵢ are processing weights
   - sᵢ are signal components
   - T is transformation function
   - H is entropy
   - β,γ are processing factors

2. **Information Flow**
   ```math
   dI/dt = F(I,x) - D∇²I + η(t)
   ```
   where:
   - I is information state
   - F is processing function
   - D is diffusion coefficient
   - η is noise term
   - x is input signal

### Processing Theory
1. **Information Integration**
   ```math
   Φ(X) = ∑ᵢⱼ I(Xᵢ;Xⱼ|X\{Xᵢ,Xⱼ})
   ```
   where:
   - Φ is integration measure
   - X is system state
   - I is mutual information
   - Xᵢ,Xⱼ are components

2. **Processing Efficiency**
   ```math
   η(t) = I_out(t)/I_in(t)
   ```
   where:
   - η is efficiency
   - I_out is output information
   - I_in is input information
   - t is time point
