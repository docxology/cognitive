# Multisensory Integration

Multisensory integration refers to the brain's ability to combine information from different sensory modalities to create a coherent perceptual experience. Within the active inference framework, it represents the optimal combination of multiple sensory predictions and prediction errors to minimize overall free energy and create the most accurate model of the environment.
