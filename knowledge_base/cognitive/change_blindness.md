# Change Blindness

Change blindness refers to the failure to detect changes in visual scenes, even when these changes are relatively large and occur in plain sight. Within the active inference framework, it represents insufficient precision-weighting of prediction errors that would normally signal scene changes, often due to disruption of the comparison process between successive visual states.

## Core Mechanisms

### Detection Processes
