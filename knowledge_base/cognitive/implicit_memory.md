# Implicit Memory

Implicit memory represents the unconscious influence of past experience on current behavior and performance. Within the active inference framework, it implements automatic precision-weighting of predictions and prediction errors without conscious awareness, optimizing behavior through unconscious free energy minimization.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Implicit Learning
1. **Unconscious Prediction**
   ```math
   P(s'|s,a) = argmin_{P} ∫ F(s',s,a)ds'
   ```
   where:
   - P(s'|s,a) is transition probability
   - s,s' are current and future states
   - a is action
   - F is variational free energy

2. **Automatic Optimization**
   ```math
   dθ/dt = -η∇_θ F(s,a; θ)
   ```
   where:
   - θ represents implicit parameters
   - η is learning rate
   - ∇_θ F is parameter gradient
   - F is free energy

### Priming Effects
1. **Response Facilitation**
   ```math
   R(t) = R₀exp(-αΔt) + β(s|c)
   ```
   where:
   - R(t) is response strength
   - R₀ is baseline response
   - α is decay rate
   - β(s|c) is context effect
   - Δt is time delay

2. **Activation Dynamics**
   ```math
   A(t) = A₀ + ∑ᵢ wᵢexp(-λᵢt)
   ```
   where:
   - A(t) is activation level
   - A₀ is baseline activation
   - wᵢ are connection weights
   - λᵢ are decay constants
