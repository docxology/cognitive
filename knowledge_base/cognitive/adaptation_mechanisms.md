# Adaptation Mechanisms

Adaptation mechanisms represent the processes by which cognitive systems modify their behavior and internal models in response to environmental changes. Within the active inference framework, adaptation implements dynamic model updating through precision-weighted prediction error minimization and homeostatic regulation.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Adaptation Dynamics
1. **State Adaptation**
   ```math
   dx/dt = -∂F/∂x + D∇²x + η(t)
   ```
   where:
   - x is system state
   - F is free energy
   - D is diffusion coefficient
   - η is noise term

2. **Error Correction**
   ```math
   Δθ = -α∇_θL(θ,x) + β(θ₀ - θ)
   ```
   where:
   - θ is parameters
   - L is loss function
   - α is learning rate
   - β is regularization
   - θ₀ is prior

### Control Theory
1. **Feedback Control**
   ```math
   u(t) = K(x*(t) - x(t)) + ∫K_i(x*(τ) - x(τ))dτ
   ```
   where:
   - u is control signal
   - K is gain matrix
   - x* is target state
   - x is current state

2. **Homeostatic Regulation**
   ```math
   dh/dt = γ(h* - h) - λ∇_hF(h,x)
   ```
   where:
   - h is homeostatic variable
   - h* is setpoint
   - γ is adaptation rate
   - λ is free energy weight
