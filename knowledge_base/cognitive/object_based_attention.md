# Object-Based Attention

Object-based attention refers to the selective processing of information based on object boundaries and structure, rather than just spatial locations or individual features. Within the active inference framework, it represents precision-weighting of predictions and prediction errors at the level of integrated object representations.

## Core Mechanisms

### Object Selection
1. **Selection Processes**
   - Object segmentation
   - Boundary detection
   - Feature integration
   - Structure analysis
   - Precision allocation

2. **Object Processing**
   - Holistic processing
   - Part relationships
   - Feature binding
   - Object completion
   - Structure maintenance

### Implementation Principles
1. **Object Organization**
   - Gestalt principles
   - Perceptual grouping
   - Feature integration
   - Structure representation
   - Object maintenance

2. **Processing Dynamics**
   - Resource allocation
   - Attention spreading
   - Object tracking
   - Update mechanisms
   - Cost management
