# Error Correction

Error correction represents the processes by which cognitive systems detect and minimize discrepancies between predicted and actual outcomes. Within the active inference framework, it implements precision-weighted prediction error minimization through dynamic model updating and parameter optimization.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Error Dynamics
1. **Prediction Error**
   ```math
   ε = x - g(μ,θ)
   ```
   where:
   - ε is prediction error
   - x is actual outcome
   - g is generative function
   - μ is current estimate
   - θ is parameters

2. **Error Minimization**
   ```math
   dμ/dt = -∂F/∂μ = Π_μ(ε_μ - ∂G/∂μ)
   ```
   where:
   - μ is state estimate
   - F is free energy
   - Π_μ is precision
   - ε_μ is state prediction error
   - G is value function

### Learning Rules
1. **Parameter Update**
   ```math
   Δθ = -α∇_θL(θ,x) + β(θ₀ - θ)
   ```
   where:
   - θ is parameters
   - L is loss function
   - α is learning rate
   - β is regularization
   - θ₀ is prior

2. **Precision Weighting**
   ```math
   w = exp(-λε'Σ⁻¹ε)
   ```
   where:
   - w is weight
   - ε is error vector
   - Σ is covariance matrix
   - λ is sensitivity
