# Schema Integration

Schema integration represents the process by which new information is incorporated into existing knowledge structures. Within the active inference framework, it implements hierarchical model updating through precision-weighted prediction errors that optimize the balance between existing schemas and new evidence.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Schema Dynamics
1. **Integration Process**
   ```math
   S'(t) = S(t) + α(E(t) - P(t))W(t)
   ```
   where:
   - S'(t) is updated schema
   - S(t) is current schema
   - E(t) is new evidence
   - P(t) is prediction
   - W(t) is precision weight
   - α is learning rate

2. **Prediction Error**
   ```math
   ε(t) = E(t) - P(S(t))
   ```
   where:
   - ε(t) is prediction error
   - E(t) is evidence
   - P(S(t)) is schema prediction

### Knowledge Organization
1. **Hierarchical Structure**
   ```math
   P(h|e) = P(e|h)P(h)/P(e)
   ```
   where:
   - h represents hierarchical level
   - e represents evidence
   - P(h) is prior probability
   - P(e|h) is likelihood

2. **Integration Cost**
   ```math
   C(S,E) = D_KL(P(S')||P(S)) + λH(S')
   ```
   where:
   - D_KL is KL divergence
   - H is entropy
   - λ is complexity cost
   - S,S' are old/new schemas
