# Learning Mechanisms

Learning mechanisms represent the processes by which cognitive systems acquire and refine knowledge and skills. Within the active inference framework, learning implements the optimization of generative models through prediction error minimization and precision-weighted updating of model parameters.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Model Learning
1. **Parameter Optimization**
   ```math
   θ' = θ - α∇_θF(x,θ)
   ```
   where:
   - θ is model parameters
   - α is learning rate
   - F is free energy
   - x is sensory input

2. **Prediction Error**
   ```math
   ε = x - g(μ,θ)
   ```
   where:
   - ε is prediction error
   - x is actual input
   - g is generative function
   - μ is current estimate
   - θ is parameters

### Learning Dynamics
1. **State Estimation**
   ```math
   dμ/dt = -∂F/∂μ = Π_μ(ε_μ - ∂G/∂μ)
   ```
   where:
   - μ is state estimate
   - Π_μ is precision
   - ε_μ is state prediction error
   - G is value function

2. **Parameter Adaptation**
   ```math
   dθ/dt = -∂F/∂θ = Π_θ(ε_θ - ∂G/∂θ)
   ```
   where:
   - θ is parameters
   - Π_θ is precision
   - ε_θ is parameter prediction error
   - G is value function
