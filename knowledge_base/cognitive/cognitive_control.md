# Cognitive Control

Cognitive control represents the system's ability to flexibly coordinate thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals. Within the active inference framework, it implements hierarchical precision control and model selection to optimize behavior through minimization of expected free energy.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Control Dynamics
1. **State Regulation**
   ```math
   dx/dt = -∂F/∂x + D∇²x + η(t)
   ```
   where:
   - x is system state
   - F is free energy
   - D is diffusion coefficient
   - η is noise term

2. **Policy Selection**
   ```math
   π* = argmin_π[G(π) + λC(π)]
   ```
   where:
   - π* is optimal policy
   - G is expected free energy
   - C is control cost
   - λ is trade-off parameter

### Control Theory
1. **Feedback Control**
   ```math
   u(t) = K(x*(t) - x(t)) + ∫K_i(x*(τ) - x(τ))dτ
   ```
   where:
   - u is control signal
   - K is gain matrix
   - x* is target state
   - x is current state

2. **Precision Control**
   ```math
   Π(t) = (Σ(t) + η(t)I)⁻¹
   ```
   where:
   - Π is precision matrix
   - Σ is uncertainty
   - η is neural noise
   - I is identity matrix
