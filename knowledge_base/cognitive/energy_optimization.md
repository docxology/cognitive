# Energy Optimization

Energy optimization represents the processes by which cognitive systems minimize metabolic costs while maintaining adaptive performance. Within the active inference framework, it implements the minimization of free energy and metabolic expenditure through precision-weighted resource allocation and model complexity control.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Energy Dynamics
1. **Metabolic Cost**
   ```math
   E(t) = ∑ᵢ wᵢaᵢ(t) + β∫C(s(τ))dτ
   ```
   where:
   - E is total energy
   - wᵢ are metabolic weights
   - aᵢ are activity levels
   - C is complexity cost
   - s is system state
   - β is efficiency factor

2. **Efficiency Function**
   ```math
   η(t) = P(t)/E(t)
   ```
   where:
   - η is efficiency
   - P is performance measure
   - E is energy cost
   - t is time point

### Optimization Theory
1. **Energy-Performance Trade-off**
   ```math
   J(a) = ∫[B(a(t),s(t)) - λE(a(t))]dt
   ```
   where:
   - J is objective function
   - B is benefit function
   - E is energy cost
   - λ is trade-off parameter
   - a is activity level
   - s is system state

2. **Complexity Control**
   ```math
   C(m) = D_KL(Q(θ|m)||P(θ)) + αH(Q)
   ```
   where:
   - C is complexity cost
   - D_KL is KL divergence
   - Q is posterior belief
   - P is prior belief
   - H is entropy
   - α is complexity weight
