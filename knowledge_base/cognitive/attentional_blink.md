# Attentional Blink

Attentional blink refers to the temporary inability to detect a second target stimulus when it appears shortly after a first target in a rapid stream of stimuli. Within the active inference framework, it represents a temporary reduction in precision-weighting during the processing and model updating triggered by the first target.
