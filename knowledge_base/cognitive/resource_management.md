# Resource Management

Resource management represents the processes by which cognitive systems allocate and optimize limited computational and energetic resources. Within the active inference framework, it implements precision-weighted resource allocation and model complexity control to minimize free energy while maintaining adaptive capacity.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Resource Dynamics
1. **Allocation Function**
   ```math
   r*(t) = argmax_r[U(r,s) - C(r)]
   ```
   where:
   - r* is optimal allocation
   - U is utility function
   - s is system state
   - C is cost function
   - t is time point

2. **Energy Constraints**
   ```math
   E(t) = ∑ᵢ wᵢrᵢ(t) ≤ E_max
   ```
   where:
   - E is total energy
   - wᵢ are energy weights
   - rᵢ are resource allocations
   - E_max is energy limit

### Optimization Theory
1. **Resource Optimization**
   ```math
   J(r) = ∫[B(r(t),s(t)) - λ'g(r(t))]dt
   ```
   where:
   - J is objective function
   - B is benefit function
   - g is constraint function
   - λ is Lagrange multiplier
   - s is system state

2. **Complexity Control**
   ```math
   C(m) = D_KL(Q(θ|m)||P(θ)) + αH(Q)
   ```
   where:
   - C is complexity cost
   - D_KL is KL divergence
   - Q is posterior belief
   - P is prior belief
   - H is entropy
   - α is complexity weight
