# Belief Updating

Belief updating represents the process by which cognitive systems revise their beliefs based on new evidence through probabilistic inference. Within the active inference framework, it implements precision-weighted prediction errors and model selection through hierarchical belief propagation.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Update Dynamics
1. **Belief Revision**
   ```math
   P(h|e) = P(e|h)P(h)/P(e)
   ```
   where:
   - P(h|e) is posterior belief
   - P(e|h) is likelihood
   - P(h) is prior belief
   - P(e) is evidence

2. **Sequential Update**
   ```math
   P(h|e₁,e₂) = P(e₂|h)P(h|e₁)/P(e₂|e₁)
   ```
   where:
   - P(h|e₁,e₂) is updated posterior
   - P(e₂|h) is new likelihood
   - P(h|e₁) is prior posterior
   - P(e₂|e₁) is predictive probability

### Update Process
1. **Belief Dynamics**
   ```math
   dμ/dt = -∂F/∂μ = π(ε - ∂G/∂μ)
   ```
   where:
   - μ is belief state
   - F is free energy
   - π is precision
   - ε is prediction error
   - G is value function

2. **Learning Rate**
   ```math
   α(t) = η/(1 + β∑ᵢ εᵢ²)
   ```
   where:
   - α is learning rate
   - η is base rate
   - β is sensitivity
   - εᵢ are prediction errors
