# Semantic Memory

Semantic memory represents the system for storing, organizing, and retrieving conceptual knowledge about the world. Within the active inference framework, it implements a hierarchical generative model that optimizes precision-weighted predictions about conceptual relationships and category structures to minimize free energy across knowledge domains.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Knowledge Representation
1. **Conceptual Structure**
   ```math
   K(c) = argmin_c F(c, f, r)
   ```
   where:
   - K(c) is the conceptual representation
   - f represents features
   - r represents relations
   - F is the variational free energy

2. **Category Organization**
   ```math
   P(c|f) = ∫ P(c|h)P(h|f)dh
   ```
   where:
   - c represents concepts
   - f represents features
   - h represents hidden states
   - P denotes probability distributions

### Information Processing
1. **Semantic Distance**
   ```math
   D(c₁,c₂) = -log₂(P(c₁|c₂)/P(c₁))
   ```
   where:
   - D is semantic distance
   - c₁,c₂ are concepts
   - P represents probability

2. **Knowledge Integration**
   ```math
   I(C;F) = ∑P(c,f)log(P(c,f)/P(c)P(f))
   ```
   where:
   - I is mutual information
   - C represents concepts
   - F represents features
