# Exogenous Attention

Exogenous attention refers to stimulus-driven, involuntary capture of attention by salient environmental events. Within the active inference framework, it represents automatic precision-weighting of unexpected sensory inputs that potentially signal important changes in the environment requiring immediate processing.
