# Pattern Recognition

Pattern recognition is a fundamental cognitive process that enables the identification, categorization, and interpretation of regularities and structures in sensory input. It is essential for learning, problem-solving, and adaptive behavior.

## Core Mechanisms

### Feature Analysis
1. **Feature Detection**
   - Basic feature extraction
   - Feature discrimination
   - Feature integration
   - Invariant feature recognition

2. **Feature Hierarchies**
   - Low-level features (edges, orientations)
   - Mid-level features (textures, shapes)
   - High-level features (objects, scenes)
   - Abstract patterns (categories, concepts)

### Pattern Processing Stages

#### 1. Preprocessing
- Noise reduction
- Contrast enhancement
- Edge detection
- Segmentation
- Normalization

#### 2. Feature Extraction
