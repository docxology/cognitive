# Performance Optimization

Performance optimization represents the processes by which cognitive systems maximize efficiency and effectiveness through adaptive control and resource allocation. Within the active inference framework, it implements precision-weighted model selection and parameter optimization to minimize free energy across multiple timescales.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Optimization Dynamics
1. **Performance Function**
   ```math
   P(θ,x) = E[R(x,a)] - λD_KL(Q(s|x)||P(s))
   ```
   where:
   - P is performance measure
   - R is reward function
   - D_KL is KL divergence
   - Q is posterior belief
   - P is prior belief
   - λ is complexity cost

2. **Resource Allocation**
   ```math
   r*(t) = argmax_r[U(r) - C(r)]
   ```
   where:
   - r* is optimal allocation
   - U is utility function
   - C is cost function
   - t is time point

### Control Theory
1. **Optimal Control**
   ```math
   J = ∫(x'Qx + u'Ru + λ'c(x,u))dt
   ```
   where:
   - J is cost function
   - Q is state cost
   - R is control cost
   - c is constraint function
   - λ is Lagrange multiplier

2. **Adaptive Learning**
   ```math
   dθ/dt = -η∇_θL(θ) + σ(t)ξ(t)
   ```
   where:
   - θ is parameters
   - L is loss function
   - η is learning rate
   - σ is noise scale
   - ξ is exploration noise
