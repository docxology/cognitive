# Computational Efficiency

Computational efficiency represents the optimization of information processing in cognitive systems through adaptive resource allocation and algorithmic optimization. Within the active inference framework, it implements precision-weighted computation and model complexity control to minimize computational costs while maintaining adaptive performance.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Efficiency Dynamics
1. **Computational Cost**
   ```math
   C(t) = ∑ᵢ wᵢpᵢ(t) + β∫M(s(τ))dτ + γI(t)
   ```
   where:
   - C is computational cost
   - wᵢ are processing weights
   - pᵢ are processing loads
   - M is model complexity
   - I is information cost
   - β,γ are efficiency factors

2. **Processing Efficiency**
   ```math
   η(t) = H(t)/C(t)
   ```
   where:
   - η is efficiency
   - H is information processed
   - C is computational cost
   - t is time point

### Optimization Theory
1. **Information-Cost Trade-off**
   ```math
   J(p) = ∫[I(p(t),s(t)) - λC(p(t))]dt
   ```
   where:
   - J is objective function
   - I is information function
   - C is computational cost
   - λ is trade-off parameter
   - p is processing level
   - s is system state

2. **Model Complexity**
   ```math
   M(θ) = D_KL(Q(θ)||P(θ)) + αH(Q)
   ```
   where:
   - M is model complexity
   - D_KL is KL divergence
   - Q is posterior belief
   - P is prior belief
   - H is entropy
   - α is complexity weight
