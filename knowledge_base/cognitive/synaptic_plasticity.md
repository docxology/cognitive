# Synaptic Plasticity

Synaptic plasticity represents the activity-dependent modification of synaptic strength and structure. Within the active inference framework, it implements the optimization of neural generative models through precision-weighted prediction error minimization at the cellular level.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Weight Dynamics
1. **Hebbian Learning**
   ```math
   dw/dt = η(x_pre * x_post - αw)
   ```
   where:
   - w is synaptic weight
   - η is learning rate
   - x_pre, x_post are pre/post-synaptic activity
   - α is decay rate

2. **STDP Rule**
   ```math
   Δw = A⁺exp(-Δt/τ⁺) if Δt > 0
   Δw = -A⁻exp(Δt/τ⁻) if Δt < 0
   ```
   where:
   - Δt is spike timing difference
   - A⁺,A⁻ are potentiation/depression amplitudes
   - τ⁺,τ⁻ are time constants

### Plasticity Mechanisms
1. **Calcium Dynamics**
   ```math
   d[Ca²⁺]/dt = I_Ca(t) - β[Ca²⁺]
   ```
   where:
   - [Ca²⁺] is calcium concentration
   - I_Ca is calcium current
   - β is decay rate

2. **Metaplasticity**
   ```math
   θ(t) = θ₀ + γ∫(v(τ) - v₀)dτ
   ```
   where:
   - θ is plasticity threshold
   - v is membrane potential
   - γ is adaptation rate
   - v₀ is reference potential
