# Inattentional Blindness

Inattentional blindness refers to the failure to notice unexpected but often conspicuous stimuli when attention is engaged elsewhere. Within the active inference framework, it represents the consequence of strong precision-weighting of task-relevant predictions that effectively suppresses prediction errors from unattended stimuli.

## Core Mechanisms

### Attention Allocation
1. **Resource Distribution**
   - Task focus
   - Capacity limitations
   - Priority setting
   - Resource constraints
   - Precision allocation

2. **Processing Selection**
   - Task demands
   - Attentional load
   - Processing depth
   - Feature selection
   - Information filtering

### Implementation Principles
1. **Selective Processing**
   - Goal relevance
   - Task requirements
   - Resource management
   - Information filtering
   - Priority optimization

2. **Capacity Limitations**
   - Processing bottlenecks
   - Resource constraints
   - Attention limits
   - Processing trade-offs
   - Energy efficiency
