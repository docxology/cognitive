# Metabolic Efficiency

Metabolic efficiency represents the optimization of energy utilization in cognitive systems through adaptive resource allocation and consumption regulation. Within the active inference framework, it implements the minimization of metabolic costs while maintaining adaptive performance through precision-weighted energy allocation.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Efficiency Dynamics
1. **Metabolic Function**
   ```math
   M(t) = ∑ᵢ wᵢaᵢ(t) + β∫C(s(τ))dτ + γR(t)
   ```
   where:
   - M is metabolic cost
   - wᵢ are metabolic weights
   - aᵢ are activity levels
   - C is complexity cost
   - R is recovery cost
   - β,γ are efficiency factors

2. **Efficiency Ratio**
   ```math
   η(t) = W(t)/M(t)
   ```
   where:
   - η is efficiency
   - W is work output
   - M is metabolic cost
   - t is time point

### Optimization Theory
1. **Energy-Work Trade-off**
   ```math
   J(a) = ∫[W(a(t),s(t)) - λM(a(t))]dt
   ```
   where:
   - J is objective function
   - W is work function
   - M is metabolic cost
   - λ is trade-off parameter
   - a is activity level
   - s is system state

2. **Recovery Dynamics**
   ```math
   dR/dt = α(R* - R) - βA(t)
   ```
   where:
   - R is resource level
   - R* is optimal level
   - A is activity level
   - α is recovery rate
   - β is depletion rate
