# Contrast Sensitivity

Contrast sensitivity is the visual system's ability to detect differences in luminance between adjacent areas. It is a fundamental measure of visual function that determines how well one can perceive objects under various lighting conditions and at different spatial scales.

## Core Components

### Basic Principles
1. **Contrast Definition**
   - Luminance differences
   - Weber contrast
   - Michelson contrast
   - RMS contrast

2. **Sensitivity Measures**
   - Threshold detection
   - Discrimination ability
   - Response functions
   - Dynamic range

### Spatial Aspects
1. **Spatial Frequency**
   - Cycles per degree
   - Frequency channels
   - Bandwidth
   - Orientation selectivity

2. **Contrast Sensitivity Function**
   - Peak sensitivity
   - Cut-off frequency
   - Low-frequency fall-off
   - High-frequency fall-off
