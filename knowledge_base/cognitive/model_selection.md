# Model Selection

Model selection represents the process by which cognitive systems choose appropriate models for different contexts through evidence accumulation and complexity balancing. Within the active inference framework, it implements precision-weighted model comparison and evidence accumulation to minimize expected free energy.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Selection Criteria
1. **Model Evidence**
   ```math
   log P(x|m) = -F(m) + D_KL(Q(θ|m)||P(θ|x,m))
   ```
   where:
   - P(x|m) is model evidence
   - F(m) is free energy
   - Q(θ|m) is posterior
   - P(θ|x,m) is true posterior
   - m is model

2. **Model Comparison**
   ```math
   P(m|x) = P(m)P(x|m)/P(x)
   ```
   where:
   - P(m|x) is posterior probability
   - P(m) is model prior
   - P(x|m) is likelihood
   - P(x) is marginal likelihood

### Selection Dynamics
1. **Evidence Accumulation**
   ```math
   dE/dt = α(E* - E) + β∫ε(τ)dτ + η(t)
   ```
   where:
   - E is evidence
   - E* is threshold
   - ε is prediction error
   - α,β are rates
   - η is noise

2. **Selection Process**
   ```math
   m* = argmax_m[log P(x|m) - λC(m)]
   ```
   where:
   - m* is selected model
   - P(x|m) is evidence
   - C(m) is complexity
   - λ is trade-off parameter
