# Endogenous Attention

Endogenous attention represents voluntary, goal-directed control of attentional resources. Within the active inference framework, it implements top-down precision control based on prior beliefs and goals to optimize information sampling and minimize expected free energy.

## Core Mechanisms

### Control Processes
1. **Voluntary Control**
   - Goal-directed selection
   - Resource allocation
