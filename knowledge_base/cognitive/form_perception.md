# Form Perception

Form perception is the cognitive process by which the visual system analyzes, organizes, and interprets the shapes and structures of objects and patterns in the visual environment. It is fundamental to object recognition and spatial understanding.

## Core Mechanisms

### Basic Form Processing
1. **Edge Detection**
   - Contrast boundaries
   - Orientation selectivity
   - Contour integration
   - Border ownership

2. **Shape Analysis**
   - Geometric properties
   - Structural features
   - Part relationships
   - Global configuration

### Form Organization
1. **Gestalt Principles**
   - Proximity
   - Similarity
   - Continuity
   - Closure
   - Common fate
   - Good form
   - Figure-ground organization

2. **Hierarchical Processing**
   - Local features
   - Global structure
   - Part-whole relationships
   - Configural processing
