# [[Socioeconomic_Active_Inference]]

## Overview

This document outlines the application of [[Active_Inference|Active Inference]] principles to socioeconomic systems within the [[biofirm_framework|BioFirm]]. It demonstrates how the [[Active_Inference/Free_Energy_Principle|Free Energy Principle]] can be used to understand and guide social and economic dynamics in bioregional contexts.

        self.economic_space = EconomicStateSpace()
        self.interaction_model = SocioeconomicInteractions()
        
    def predict_dynamics(self, current_state, policy=None):
        """Predict future socioeconomic states"""
        # Model social changes
        # Project economic outcomes
        # Account for policy effects
```

        self.governance_system = GovernanceSystem()
        self.policy_evaluator = PolicyEvaluator()
        
    def evaluate_policy(self, current_state, proposed_policy):
        """Evaluate policy impacts"""
        # Assess social implications
        # Project economic effects
        # Consider equity impacts
```

### 2. [[Active_Inference/Economic_Control|Economic Control]]
```python
class EconomicController:
    """Active inference-based economic system management"""

        self.market_model = MarketModel()
        self.resource_allocator = ResourceAllocator()
        self.value_optimizer = ValueOptimizer()
        
    def optimize_allocation(self, resources, objectives):
        """Optimize resource allocation"""
        # Balance objectives
        # Consider constraints
        # Maximize value creation

## Mathematical Framework

### 1. Social Free Energy
```math

- p(s_{soc},o_{soc}): Social generative model

### 2. Economic Free Energy
```math
F_{eco} = E_q[ln q(s_{econ}) - ln p(s_{econ},o_{econ})]
```
where:
- s_{econ}: Economic states
- o_{econ}: Economic observations
- q(s_{econ}): Beliefs about economic states
- p(s_{econ},o_{econ}): Economic generative model

### 3. Policy Selection
```math
π* = argmin_π [G_{soc}(π) + G_{econ}(π)]
```
where:
- G_{soc}: Social expected free energy
- G_{econ}: Economic expected free energy
- π: Policy options
