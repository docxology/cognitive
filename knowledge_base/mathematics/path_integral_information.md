# Path Integral Information Theory

Path integral information theory unifies path integrals with information-theoretic principles to describe information processing in dynamical systems. This framework is particularly relevant for understanding cognitive systems through the lens of active inference and the free energy principle.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Information Path Integrals
1. **Path Information Measure**
   ```math
   I[x(t)] = ∫ dt L(x(t), ẋ(t), t)
   ```
   where:
   - I[x(t)] is path information
   - L is information Lagrangian
   - x(t) is system trajectory

2. **Path Entropy**
   ```math
   S[P] = -∫ 𝒟x P[x(t)]log P[x(t)]
   ```
   where:
   - S[P] is path entropy
   - P[x(t)] is path probability
   - 𝒟x is path measure

### Dynamic Information Flow
1. **Information Action**
   ```math
   A[x(t)] = ∫ dt [D(ẋ - f(x))² + Q(x)]
   ```
   where:
   - D is diffusion tensor
   - f(x) is drift field
   - Q(x) is information potential

2. **Path Transition Probability**
   ```math
   P[x(t)|x₀] = N exp(-A[x(t)]/σ²)
   ```
   where:
   - N is normalization
   - σ² is noise variance
   - A[x(t)] is information action

## Active Inference Implementation

### Free Energy Path Integrals
1. **Path Free Energy**
   ```math
   F[q] = ∫ 𝒟x q[x(t)]{log(q[x(t)]/p[x(t)]) + S[x(t)]}
   ```
   where:
   - F[q] is path free energy
   - q[x(t)] is variational path density
   - S[x(t)] is path action

2. **Expected Free Energy**
   ```math
   G[π] = ∫ dt E_{q(o,s|π)}[log q(s|π) - log p(o,s)]
   ```
   where:
   - G[π] is expected free energy
   - π is policy
   - q(o,s|π) is predicted distribution

### Information Geometry
1. **Path Fisher Information**
   ```math
   g_μν[x(t)] = E[∂_μlog p(x(t))∂_νlog p(x(t))]
   ```
   where:
   - g_μν is metric tensor
   - p(x(t)) is path probability
   - ∂_μ is functional derivative

2. **Natural Gradient Flow**
   ```math
   ẋ = -g^{μν}∂_νF[x(t)]
   ```
   where:
   - g^{μν} is inverse metric
   - F[x(t)] is free energy
   - ∂_ν is covariant derivative

## Computational Methods

### Path Sampling
1. **Information-Guided Sampling**
   ```python
   def sample_information_paths(
       initial_state: np.ndarray,
       info_action: Callable,
       num_samples: int
   ) -> np.ndarray:
       """Sample paths weighted by information content."""
       paths = []
       for _ in range(num_samples):
           path = generate_candidate_path(initial_state)
           weight = np.exp(-info_action(path))
           if accept_path(weight):
               paths.append(path)
       return np.array(paths)
   ```

2. **Path Information Estimation**
   ```python
   def estimate_path_information(
       paths: np.ndarray,
       info_measure: Callable
   ) -> float:
       """Estimate information content of path ensemble."""
       path_infos = [info_measure(p) for p in paths]
       return np.mean(path_infos)
   ```

### Optimization Methods
1. **Information Action Minimization**
   ```python
   def minimize_info_action(
       initial_path: np.ndarray,
       info_action: Callable,
       learning_rate: float
   ) -> np.ndarray:
       """Minimize information action functional."""
       current_path = initial_path.copy()
       while not converged:
           gradient = compute_action_gradient(
               current_path, info_action)
           current_path -= learning_rate * gradient
       return current_path
   ```

2. **Path Free Energy Optimization**
   ```python
   def optimize_path_free_energy(
       variational_density: Callable,
       target_density: Callable,
       num_iterations: int
   ) -> Callable:
       """Optimize variational path density."""
       for _ in range(num_iterations):
           paths = sample_paths(variational_density)
           gradient = compute_free_energy_gradient(
               paths, target_density)
           variational_density = update_density(
               variational_density, gradient)
       return variational_density
   ```
